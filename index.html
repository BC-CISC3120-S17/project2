        <h1>Project Two: WebSockets Checkers</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>The main objective of this project is to give you experience writing WebSockets code.


        <p>The project is due at 8am on the day of the final. I will
        clone your repositories for grading at that time.</p>

        <h2>The Project</h2>

        <p>In this project, you will take the infrastructure for a simple GUI game&mdash;checkers&mdash;and add WebSockets code that will allow the game to be played over a network.</p>

        <h3>The Existing Code</h3>

        <p>The code in this repository is in three packages.</p>

        <p><code>checkers.client</code> contains GUI code for drawing a checkerboard. <code>
            CheckersClient
          </code> is a simple Swing application which draws a checkerboard and also listens for mouse activity. <code>
            CheckersCanvas
          </code> is the class that actually draws the board&mdash;it also includes code that helps the controller convert mouse-clock locations into board locations. The <code>
CheckersCanvas
          </code> includes a reference to a <code>
            CheckerBoard
          </code>&mdash; see below.

        </p>
        <p><code>checkers.common</code> contains classes used by both the client and server. These provide part of the "model": it represents the board (<code>CheckerBoard</code>), the squares on the board (<code>Square</code>), and the players who may occupy those squares (<code>SquarePlayer</code>). The client, for example, will use this lightweight model to draw the board.</p>

          <p>Finally, <code>checkers.server</code> contains a "heavier" model (<code>CheckersModel</code>) which includes the rules of checkers&mdash; which jumps are legal? when does a checker get kinged? and so on. Note that the client will run as it is, but no checkers will be drawn.</p>

        <h3>A Network Architecture</h3>
        <p>This code is ready to be embedded in a WebSockets application. Here's the idea: Once a "checkers server" starts, clients can connect in order to play. Once two clients have connected, the server lets them start playing. When a client tries to make a move, a message is sent to the server. If the move is not legal, an "illegal move" message is sent back to the client, and nothing else happens. If the move <em>is</em> legal, then the server sends a message to both clients, letting them know that the move has been made and indicating that it's the other player's turn. The clients, in turn, should update their display of the board and let the users know whose turn it is.</p>

        <p><em>Important:</em> when a user tries to make a move, the client should <em>not</em> display that move immediately&mdash;it MUST send the move to the server. (The client doesn't have enough intelligence to know whether the move is legal, or even whether it's the local player's turn to move.) The display should only ever be updated in response to a message from the server.</p>

        <p>Of course, when a player wins, the server should send an appropriate message, and the clients, upon receiving that message, should end play.</p>

        <h2>What You Need to Do</h2>

        <p>The GUI code and checkers-model code is in good shape. Your focus is on communication: What kinds of messages will the clients send to the server? What kinds of messages will the server send to the clients?</p>

        <p>How will your client code actually send messages to, and receive messages from, the server? When should such messages be sent?</p>

        <p>On the server side, how will you code a relationship between the WebSockets endpoint and the checkers model?</p>

        <p>Don't worry! We're going to look at a few other WebSockets applications so that you'll have some examples to build from.</p>
        
        
    <h2>Behavior</h2>

        <p>Your application should
        <ol>
        <li>allow clients to connect to the server</li>
        <li>allow the clients to play a "legal" game of checkers</li>
        <li>inform players when a game has ended</li>
        </ol></p>

       
        
  <h2>Grading</h2>

  As usual, this project is to be completed individually. Grading will be based as follows:

        <p>
          <b>40% Correctness</b>. Does the game play properly? 
        </p>
                

        <p>
          <b>20% WebSockets</b>. Are the messages you send efficient, effective, sensible? Does your message-handling code work?
        </p>
            
                <p><b>20% Documentation</b>. Your project should include
                three kinds of documentation, as described in the <a
                    href="http://bc-cisc3120-s17.github.io/documentation.html">About
                    Documentation</a> page. You should provide doccomments
                for each class and method in your project, and generate
                HTML documentation using javadoc. For this project, the
                <code>README.md</code> file in your repository
                needs only to contain a "Works Cited" section: Any
                website, book, or similar resource from which you get
                useful guidance must be listed here, along with a brief
                description of what you got from it (a bit of code? an
                explanation? an answer to a question?). You do not need
                to list the Java API or either of the two books
                required/recommended for class. If you use no other
                resources, then your "Works Cited" section must simply
                contain the word <em>None</em>.<p>
            
                <p><b>20% Style</b>. As before, your code should be properly
        formatted, with enough (but not too much) whitespace. Eclipse
        will do most of this for you; make sure you let it help you.
        Variable names, metohd names, etc, should all be
        "self-documenting" but not excessively long (one-letter
        variables names should <em>only</em> be used as loop counters).
        <em>Generally</em>, you can use any style you like, as long as
        you're consistent. If you're not sure what style to use, follow
        the <a
            href="https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/src/java/com/twitter/common/styleguide.md">GitHub 
            Style Guide</a>, except where Eclipse's automatic formatting
        contradicts these guidelines.</p>
  
  
<p><b>Extra Credit</b>.
   <p>You could also add extra functionality to make the game more enjoyable. For example, you might to incorporate a chat behavior so that the players can talk trash.  (But please get the basic application working before you think much about extra stuff!) </p>
